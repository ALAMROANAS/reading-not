# Expressions and operators

## operators

*Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result. As we explore the operators of the Java programming language, 
*

*An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.*

# loops

**Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.**

**There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)**

**The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.**

# for statement

**A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.**

*for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])*

# javascript

**JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.**

**The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.**

**Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.** 

*For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:*

# JavaScript Operators

*for example:*

Assign values to variables and add them together:

var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x

var y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y

var z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)
